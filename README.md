Word Guess Game

The goal of this project was to build a word guess game using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The player gets to try to guess and spell the right color based on how many underscores that are presented to the player as hints. 

The project is useful for my learning of javascript and tying it in to what I have learned about html and css. 

All the user has to do is press any key to begin.  I have a section that logs wrong keys and it also shows which keys are right in the correct guess.
