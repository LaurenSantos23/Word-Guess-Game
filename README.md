Word Guess Game

The goal of this project is to build a word guess game. The player gets to try to guess and spell the right color based on how many "_" there are.  

It is supposed to keep score and tally wins and losses, I am currently working on the project to reflect this requirement. 

The project is useful for my learning of javascript and tying it in to what I have learned about html and css. 

All the user has to do is press any key to begin.  I have a section that logs wrong keys and it also shows which keys are right in the correct guess, unless its a character that appers twice, since I have not figured out how to add parameters. 

This project is a hot mess, and I plan to fix and add code to make it function with scores being tallied and a reset function. 

I, Lauren Santosuosso, am the sole person working on this, but I did watch a tutorial made by git user: andyemnem63. I used his code as my framework for the project.
